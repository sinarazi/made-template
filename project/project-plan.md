# Project: Forecasting Agricultural and Climate Impacts Using Machine Learning

## Overview
This research uses cutting edge machine learning techniques to study and forecast the environmental effects of agricultural practices and climate change. We will create predictive models to comprehend and anticipate environmental repercussions, assisting in the development of sustainable plans, by combining statistics on agricultural CO2 emissions and more general climate measurements

## Main Question
How can machine learning help forecast and analyze the environmental effects of agricultural activities and climate change?

## Description
This study attempts to analyze the combined impacts of climate-related data, such as temperature and sea level variations, and agricultural CO2 emissions on global environmental trends using databases connected to these variables. The knowledge learned will help create sustainable and efficient environmental management strategies.
