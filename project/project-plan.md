# Project Plan

## Title
Impact of Air Pullution on Urban Climate in London

## Main Question
How do variations in air pollution levels impact weather conditions in London from 2008 to 2018?

## Description
This project examines the relationship between London's air pollution levels and weather from 2008 to 2018. The goal is to examine how changes in the weather might affect air quality by using historical weather data along with pollution measurements. The project integrates data from the London Datastore and Kaggle to investigate relationships between weather patterns and pollution indices, including its impact of temperature on gasses and particle matter. Our goal is to get a deeper understanding of the environmental dynamics in metropolitan London through this study.

## Data Sources
### London Weather Data
- **Source**: Kaggle
- **URL**: [London Weather Data on Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/emmanuelfwerr/london-weather-data)
- **Period**: 1979 - 2021
- **Description**: This dataset includes historical weather data from London, collected from a weather station near Heathrow Airport. It features daily measurements such as temperature, humidity, and precipitation.

### London Air Quality Levels
- **Source**: London Datastore
- **URL**: [London Average Air Quality Levels](https://data.london.gov.uk/dataset/london-average-air-quality-levels)
- **Period**: Data available till 2019
- **Description**: This dataset provides readings of air pollutants including Nitric Oxide, Nitrogen Dioxide, Particulate Matter (PM10 and PM2.5), and Ozone. Measurements are collected from various monitoring sites across Greater London.
- **License**: UK Open Government Licence (OGL v2)


## Work Packages
1. **Data Preparation**: Standardize, clean, and preprocess the datasets for analysis.
2. **Data Integration**: Merge datasets based on the timestamp to correlate weather conditions with pollution metrics.
3. **Analytical Modeling**: Use statistical models to analyze the pollution levels.
4. **Visualization**: Develop interactive charts and graphs to visualize trends and correlations.
5. **Documentation and Reporting**: Prepare a detailed project report and presentation outlining the methodology, findings, and recommendations.
